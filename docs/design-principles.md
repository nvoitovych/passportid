# Design principles

Common principles:
1. Clarity over decoration

Every interaction reveals intent.

2. Obvious first, advanced later

Progressive disclosure.

3. Low cognitive load

One primary action per screen.

4. Friendly minimalism

Whitespace = structure.
Remove everything not needed for the task.

5. Predictable interaction patterns

Don’t surprise users unless it improves efficiency.

6. Speed is part of the product

0–100ms interaction budget.

7. Respect the platform

Web should feel like the web (not like a fake desktop app).

W3C & WHATWG standards

These define behavioral expectations:

accessibility (WCAG)

interaction patterns

focus indicators

motion reduction

responsive layouts

semantic structure

Think of this as the “underlying OS rules” for the web.
